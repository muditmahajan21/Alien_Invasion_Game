Alien_Invasion_Game

A basic 2-D game developed in Python using 'pygame' library.

# The goal of the game is to shoot down as many as possible aliens who want to crash your spaceship.
# Given a spaceship at the bottom of the game-screen, shoot 3 bullets at a time to shoot the alien fleet coming down for you.
# Take care to not let any of them slip through you or get hit by one of them as it would mean 'Game Over!!'
# Given 3 lives at the start of every game, try to keep your score as high as possible.

Enjoy!!
