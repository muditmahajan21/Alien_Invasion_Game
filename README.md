Alien_Invasion_Game

A basic 2-D game developed in Python using 'pygame' library.

1. The goal of the game is to shoot down as many as possible aliens who want to crash your spaceship.
2. Given a spaceship at the bottom of the game-screen, shoot 3 bullets at a time to shoot the alien fleet coming down for you.
3. Take care to not let any of them slip through you or get hit by one of them as it would mean 'Game Over!!'
4. Given 3 lives at the start of every game, try to keep your score as high as possible.

Enjoy!!
